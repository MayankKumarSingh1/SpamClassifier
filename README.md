The Spam Classifier is a machine learning application developed in Python that identifies and classifies messages as spam or not spam. This project utilizes various algorithms and techniques to achieve high accuracy in spam detection.

Features:
  Text Classification: Classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam).
  Machine Learning Algorithms: Implements various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression.
  Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses text data for better model performance.
  Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  User -Friendly Interface: Simple command-line interface for inputting messages and receiving predictions.
  Visualization: Visualizes data and model performance using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Technologies Used:
  Python: Main programming language for the application.
  Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  NumPy: For numerical operations.
  Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
  Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Installation
  To set up the Spam Classifier locally, follow these steps:
  
  Clone the repository:
  
  git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SpamClassifier.git
  Navigate to the project directory:
  
  cd SpamClassifier
  Install dependencies:
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  Run the application:
  
  python spam_classifier.py

Input a message when prompted.
The classifier will predict whether the message is spam or not.
